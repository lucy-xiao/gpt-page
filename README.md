This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

There is a password in order to get past the login screen, get it from .env file.
In order to publish to GH Pages, the project needs to be compiled into static HTML files, which changes how picture imports happen. 

For local development, comment out the inside of `nextConfig`, and make sure all picture URLs start with "/". Otherwise when commiting, make sure picture urls do not start with "/" and make sure `nextConfig` code is uncommented.

GH Pages is deployed on commit push to master branch.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
